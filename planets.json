    "planet": "sun",
    "overview": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System and by far its largest object. Its gravitational pull provides the centripetal force that keeps the Solar System in orbit. The Sun is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most 1  luminous object in the solar system, and is the source of all energy on Earth.",

    "overview-img": "assets/img/venus.svg",
    "internal-structure": "The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust.

    "internal-structure": "Like Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense materials. Scientists initially determined that the core is at least partially liquid.

    "overview-img": "assets/img/jupiter.svg",
    "internal-structure": "When the Juno arrived in 2016, it found that Jupiter has a very diffuse core that mixes into its mantle.

    "internal-structure": "Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass is not in the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01 g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass.",
